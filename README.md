# INSA 5IF OT8 Text Mining - TP1 Text classification

In this exercise, you will work in small groups.

You have at your disposal a dataset containing Stack Overflow questions and tags. The file, named "stack-overflow-data.csv" is a comma separated value file, containing 2 columns : the first column containing StackOverflow question texts, the second column containing tags specifying programming languages.

The goal of this exercise is to write a program that trains on a subset (75%) of the lines of this dataset and is able to correctly guess the tags of the questions contained in the remaining lines.

You can use the programming language and libraries you want.

Prepare a short presentation of your solution, detailing your approach and the evaluation steps for your solution.
